# squat-detection-application

This is a desktop application that utilizes `mediapipe` library for pose estimation to detect squats. This application is being deployed in Romania to encourage people to do squats, at the end of a certain successful number of squats (e.g. 5), the vending machine will dispense a coin to the customers. 

The application is being deployed in an [Intel NUC mini pc](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/nuc/mini-pcs/products.htm) which maintains serial communication with a coin-dispenser machine.
